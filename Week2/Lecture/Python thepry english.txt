Python theory (English)

Python is a programming language: we use it to write instructions that a computer can execute. It is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used for many different tasks — from simple scripts and automation to web applications, data analysis, and AI.

Why Python is so popular
Python is close to plain English: it has less “extra” syntax, so beginners can read and write code faster. It also has a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks — for web (Django, FastAPI), data (pandas), and machine learning (scikit-learn), and many more. Python is cross-platform as well: the same code usually runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

How Python runs
Python is commonly executed by an interpreter. The code is run step by step (instead of being fully compiled into a single executable beforehand, like in many compiled languages). This makes development faster: you write code, run it, and immediately see results.

How it differs from other languages
Compared to C/C++, Python is usually easier to read and write, but often slower in raw execution speed because many checks and actions happen at runtime.
Compared to Java/C#, Python often requires fewer lines of code to achieve the same result and is easier to start with, while Java/C# are frequently chosen in large enterprise systems for stricter typing and established tooling.
Compared to JavaScript: JavaScript is the main language of the browser, while Python is more common on the server side, automation, and data work (although both can be used in multiple areas).

Key Python features for beginners
Indentation matters: it defines code blocks instead of curly braces.
Python is dynamically typed: variable types are inferred automatically, but types still exist and are checked at runtime.
Python is great for learning because you can go from theory to practice very quickly.

Where Python is used in real life
Automation and scripting (batch tasks, file processing, reports).
Web development (backend services and APIs).
Data Science and Machine Learning (data analysis, building models).
Testing and DevOps tooling.
